# Face-Mask-Detector
Face mask detection system to identify unmasked people using python.

To directly test the face mask detector run 'app.py'

and make sure that you have following things

the packages are 

1.os 

2.NumPy 

3.Matplotlib 

4.TensorFlow 

5.Sklearn 

6.OpenCv 

and 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml' and 'MaskNet1.hdf5' in same directory

The procedure for detailed training and testing of detector

download datasets from this link

//Creating and training the model

install following packages 

1.os 

2.NumPy 

3.Matplotlib 

4.TensorFlow 

5.Sklearn 

6.OpenCv 


after succesfully installing all packegs  run code in 'FaceMask_Train.ipynb' file

Then it will create 'data.npy','labels.npy' and 'MaskNet1.hdf5' 

We are ready to test our Face mask detector tool

now run 'Main.ipynb', then a window opens which captures the video stream from the camera and the results in the real time.
